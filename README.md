_"k-means" clustering algorithm:_

- unsupervised learning: no labels.
- partitioning clustering: each sample is assigned to one cluster, without overlapping.
- np-hard problem: no known polynomial time algorithm, but we try to approximate it through iterative refinement.
- dataset: scikit-learn's iris dataset with 3 species (therefore $k=3$).

  a naive k-3 implementation [usually fails](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#:~:text=the%20result%20often%20fails) but we're doing it anyway out of tradition. in practice, we would use [`sklearn.cluster.KMeans`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) and more sophisticated methods anyway.

_implementation:_

1. select the number of clusters, $k$.

2. place $k$ random vectors in the space of the data points, called "centroids".

   there are many ways to initialize the centroids. the ["forgy method"](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tieu/notebook/kmeans/15_p600-hamerly.pdf) delivers the best results in practice - but there are more sophisticated methods like ["k-means++"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B).

3. calculate the distance between every data point and centroid (i.e. some euclidean distance).

4. assign each data point to the cluster of the closest centroid, forming $k$ clusters.

5. update the position of the centroids. set them to the average position of the data points in the cluster.

   mathematically, this means partitioning the data points according to the "Voronoi diagram" generated by the means.

6. repeat until the centroids stop moving (or some other criteria).

   but beware: k-means is sensitive to the initial placement of the centroids and it might not converge to the global minimum.
